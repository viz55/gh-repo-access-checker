GitHub Repository Access Checker:

This script helps you list all GitHub users with read (pull) access to a given repository.
It uses the GitHub REST API, a personal access token (PAT) for authentication, and the jq command-line JSON processor.

It can be deployed and executed on an AWS EC2 instance (or any Linux-based environment with bash, curl, and jq installed).

1)Features:

Fetches the list of collaborators for a GitHub repository.

Filters and displays only those with read access (pull permission).

Useful for auditing access to your repositories.

chmod +x github_read_access_checker.sh


5)Run the script with:

./github_read_access_checker.sh <repo_owner> <repo_name>
